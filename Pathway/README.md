We have gone through several version of the pathway scripts. I am keeping them here for reference.

- `Pathway.R` is the current script to be used for all future analyses.
- `Pathway_DAVID.R` is the script to be used for all analyses prior to May 2021. This depends on getting results from the DAVID webserver. 
- `Pathway_2020.R` is a slightly older, unmerged version of `Pathway_DAVID.R`. In reading through the script, I don't believe it is actually functional though.
- `Pathway_figure.R` is a pared-down version of `Pathway_2020.R` that only produces figures, also likely non-functional.
- `GSEA.R` is the current script to complete a gene set enrichment analysis. This replaces the [GSEA software](https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/index.jsp) we had used previously.
